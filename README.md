  -->Multiple LANs Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer
This project simulates a network setup using Cisco Packet Tracer, consisting of multiple LANs connected by 6 routers, 4 switches, 1 access point, and various end devices like PCs and servers. This topology can be used for experimenting with network configuration, communication between LANs, and understanding how devices connect and transfer data across different networks.

-->Features
6 Routers: Interconnect multiple LANs.
4 Switches: Provide network connectivity within each LAN.
1 Access Point: Enables wireless communication within the network.
PCs and Servers: End devices to simulate traffic and services.
-->Network Design
Each LAN consists of a router, switch, and PCs/servers.
Routers are connected to form a larger network, enabling communication between the LANs.
The access point provides wireless connectivity to the devices in one LAN.
-->Purpose
This setup is designed to:

Experiment with routing protocols.
Simulate real-world network configurations.
Test communication between multiple LANs and wireless devices.
-->Getting Started
Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer.
Clone this repository and open the .pkt file in Packet Tracer.
Configure routers, switches, and access point as needed.
Test connectivity between different devices in various LANs.
-->Usage
Experiment with different routing protocols like RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, or static routing.
Test DHCP, DNS, or web servers on the PCs/servers.
Simulate data traffic and analyze performance.
-->Requirements
Cisco Packet Tracer version 7.2 or higher.
